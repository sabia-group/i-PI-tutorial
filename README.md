# CNPEM-MPI Joint Meeting 2025: Tutorial on Nuclear Quantum Effects

## Overview

In this tutorial you will learn how to calculate thermodynamic properties at thermal equilibrium using i-PI. You will include nuclear quantum effects into your calculations by running path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD). In the first part, you will compute the equilibrium density of low-temperature para-hydrogen by running an NpT simulation. In the second part, you will explore different strategies for calculating quantum free energy differences.

## Installation

Install the python packages, in a virtual environment if need be:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Put the tutorial modules into the system path

```bash
source env.sh
```

Make sure i-PI is also in the system path:
```bash
source /path/to/i-pi/env.sh
```

Now you're ready to go!
